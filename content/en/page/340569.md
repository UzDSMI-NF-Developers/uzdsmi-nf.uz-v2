## TRANSLATION:

My country, sunny and free, salvation to your people,  
You are a warmhearted companion to the friends  
Flourish eternally with knowledge and invention,  
May your fame shine as long as the world exists!

_Refrain:_

These golden valleys-dear Uzbekistan,  
Manly spirit of ancestors is companion to you!  
When the great power of people became exuberant  
You are the country that amazes the world!

Belief of generous Uzbek does not die out,  
Free, young children are a strong wing for you!  
The torch of independence, guardian of peace,  
Just motherland be eternally prosperous!

_Refrain:_

These golden valleys-dear Uzbekistan,  
Manly spirit of ancestors is companion to you!  
When the great power of people became exuberant  
You are the country that amazes the world!
