The National Flag of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is blue, yellow and green, with yellow and white corridors in the center.

The blue color of the flag is the eternal symbol of spring youth - water. The yellow color indicates that a large part of the territory of Karakalpakstan consists of deserts. Green is a symbol of natureâ€™s renewal, spiritual rejuvenation, confidence, and the sun. While the month of birth on the flag is a sacred symbol of Muslims, the image of the five stars is a symbol of the five ancient and modern cities of Karakalpakstan - the strongholds of life and trust of the people of Karakalpakstan.
